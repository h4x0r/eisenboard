## üéØ Core Philosophy

**Build software that works reliably, ships quickly, and evolves gracefully through systematic principles and AI-human collaboration.**

---

## üèóÔ∏è Universal Design Principles

### 1. **Quality Without Compromise**
> "Tools must be more reliable than the problems they solve"

- **Verification-First Principle**: Always validate assumptions, inputs, and outputs
- **Fail Fast**: Validate inputs early and provide clear error messages
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple overlapping validation checks, not single points of failure
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial functionality better than complete failure
- **Observable Operations**: Log decisions and make system behavior transparent

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- **Documentation Standards**: ALL documentation must prioritize user success paths
- **No Unsafe Examples**: Never show potentially harmful operations without proper safeguards
- **Consistency Requirement**: Help text, documentation, and examples must use identical patterns

### 2. **Developer Experience as Core Feature**
> "Friction is the enemy of adoption"

- **Fast Feedback**: Optimize for quick iteration cycles
- **Clear Fix Instructions**: Every failure provides specific remediation steps
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start minimal, add complexity incrementally
- **Sensible Defaults**: Work out-of-the-box for 80% of use cases
- **Emergency Escape Hatches**: Bypass mechanisms for critical situations

**Performance Budget:**
- Local operations: < 60 seconds total
- Individual checks: < 30 seconds each
- Tool installation: < 5 minutes
- First-time setup: < 10 minutes

### 3. **Ecosystem Integration**
> "Work with each technology ecosystem, not against it"

- **Native Tooling**: Leverage existing tooling and conventions for each language/platform
- **Standard Tool Chain**: Use community-standard tools for each ecosystem
- **Backward Compatibility**: Don't break existing workflows
- **Cross-Platform**: Support major development platforms
- **CI/CD Friendly**: Integrate seamlessly with automation systems

### 4. **Observable Development**
> "You can't improve what you can't measure"

- **Comprehensive Logging**: All important decisions logged with context
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance, adoption, effectiveness metrics
- **Audit Trails**: Complete history of system evolution
- **Clear Reporting**: Actionable reports for all stakeholders
- **Proactive Alerting**: Early warning of issues

### 5. **Dogfooding Philosophy**
> "If it's not good enough for us, it's not good enough for users"

- **Repository as Test**: Use your own tools in your daily development
- **Enhanced Development Controls**: Additional tooling for your specific development needs
- **Quality Assurance Through Use**: Discover issues before users encounter them
- **Trust Through Transparency**: Users can inspect your processes

## üîß Implementation Standards

### Engineering Best Practices
> "Quality code is maintainable code"

**Core Programming Principles:**
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract common patterns into reusable components
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Implement only what's needed now
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Choose simple solutions when both work
- **SINE (Simple Is Not Easy)**: Simple solutions require more thought than complex ones
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **No Special Cases**: Design general solutions rather than hardcoded exceptions
- **Immutable by Default**: Prefer immutable data structures and functional approaches

**External Integration Standards:**
- **Documentation-First**: Study API documentation thoroughly before implementation
- **Version Pinning**: Always pin external dependencies to specific versions
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle external service failures without breaking core functionality
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect external API limits and implement backoff strategies
- **Timeout Handling**: Set reasonable timeouts for all external calls

**Code Organization:**
- **Modular Architecture**: Organize code into logical, testable modules
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define explicit contracts between components
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep business logic separate from I/O operations
- **Configuration Management**: Externalize configuration, never hardcode values
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of files, connections, and other resources

**Performance and Reliability:**
- **Early Optimization**: Profile before optimizing, measure impact
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache expensive operations with proper invalidation
- **Memory Management**: Be conscious of memory usage and potential leaks
- **Concurrent Safety**: Design for thread safety when applicable
- **Idempotency**: Operations should be safe to retry

---

## üé® User Experience Principles

### Installation Experience
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show basic options first, advanced on request
- **Sensible Defaults**: Work out-of-the-box for majority of projects
- **Clear Feedback**: Progress indicators and status messages
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial installation better than complete failure

### Developer Workflow
- **Invisible When Working**: Tools run automatically without intervention
- **Visible When Broken**: Clear, actionable error messages with fixes
- **Respectful of Time**: Fast feedback loops, no waiting
- **Learning Oriented**: Help developers understand concepts
- **Emergency Friendly**: Bypass mechanisms for critical fixes

### Error Messages and Guidance
```bash
‚ùå Configuration error detected

   Problem: Missing required field 'api_key' in config.yaml

   Fix: Add api_key to your configuration file
        echo "api_key: your_key_here" >> config.yaml

   For emergency bypass: export SKIP_CONFIG_CHECK=1
   (Use bypass only for critical hotfixes)
```

### Documentation Organization and User Journey
- **Quickstart First**: Always put quickstart guides at the top of documentation lists
- **Cognitive Load Minimization**: Order content by user journey complexity (basic ‚Üí intermediate ‚Üí expert)
- **Smooth Flow and Pacing**: Optimize information architecture for immediate action, then progressive learning
- **User-Centric Navigation**: Structure all documentation around user intent, not system architecture

**Implementation Standards:**
- **New Users**: Quick Start ‚Üí Installation Guide ‚Üí Basic Configuration
- **Power Users**: Architecture ‚Üí Advanced Features ‚Üí Customization
- **Contributors**: Contributing Guide ‚Üí Technical Details ‚Üí Design Principles
- **Navigation Order**: Get Started ‚Üí Power Users ‚Üí Development/Contributing
- **Link Organization**: Essential actions before technical deep-dives

**Rationale**: Users arrive with specific intents - most want to get started quickly. Bury advanced technical details below actionable guides to reduce abandonment and improve success rates.

### Visual Priority and Reading Patterns
- **Left-to-Right Priority**: Place highest priority information in leftmost columns (users read left‚Üíright, top‚Üíbottom)
- **Scannable Priority**: Use visual indicators (emojis, colors, typography) in the leftmost position for instant priority recognition
- **Table Design**: Priority column should be first column, followed by identification, then details
- **Executive Readability**: Senior management should see critical vs. non-critical items within first 2 seconds of scanning

**Examples:**
```markdown
‚úÖ Good: | üö® CRITICAL | V1 | Identity Spoofing | ...
‚ùå Bad:  | V1 | Identity Spoofing | ... | üö® CRITICAL
```

**Rationale**: Human reading patterns follow F-pattern (focus on left edge), so priority indicators must be positioned where attention naturally falls first.

## üöÄ Development Workflow

### Task Prioritization: "Informed Frog Eating" Approach

**Philosophy**: Optimize for both peak cognitive utilization and context building through strategic task sequencing.

**Three-Phase Process:**

**Phase 1: Rapid Reconnaissance (2-3 minutes)**
- Quick scan of ALL tasks to identify true complexity and scope
- Surface hidden dependencies, cascade effects, and blockers
- Assess context switching costs and information requirements
- Map relationships between tasks (which enable/block others)

**Phase 2: Strategic Prioritization**
- **Eat the Frog IF**: Clear scope + no dependencies + truly blocking other work
- **Build Context IF**: Multiple simple tasks create foundational understanding for complex work
- **Parallel Process IF**: Can batch related tasks efficiently with shared context
- **Defer Complex IF**: Insufficient information or context requires preliminary work

**Phase 3: Adaptive Execution**
- Monitor for emerging blockers and complexity escalation
- Switch to frog-eating mode when blockers become apparent
- Continue context-building on simple tasks when they inform complex work
- Batch context-heavy operations (file reads, system analysis)

**Decision Matrix:**
```
High Impact + High Complexity + Clear Scope = EAT THE FROG üê∏
High Impact + Low Complexity = BUILD CONTEXT FIRST ‚ö°
Low Impact + High Complexity = DEFER OR ELIMINATE ‚è∏Ô∏è
Multiple Related Tasks = BATCH PROCESS üì¶
```

**Applied Examples:**
- **Frog**: Establishing core architecture patterns (affects all components)
- **Context**: Fixing typos across multiple files (builds codebase understanding)
- **Batch**: Reading multiple config files for comprehensive understanding
- **Defer**: Complex refactoring when requirements are still unclear

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- ‚ùå Starting complex work without understanding full scope
- ‚ùå Building context through work that will be invalidated by harder tasks
- ‚ùå Context switching between unrelated complex problems
- ‚ùå Avoiding hard but critical decisions that block progress

### File Management and Impact Analysis

**Critical Rule**: File renames, moves, and deletions require comprehensive impact analysis across the entire codebase.

**Problem**: When files are renamed or moved, references can be scattered across:
- Documentation internal links
- CI/CD workflow files (`.github/workflows/*.yml`)
- Scripts and automation tools
- Configuration files (`package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.)
- Cross-references in other documentation

**Required Process for File Changes:**
1. **Pre-Change Analysis**: Search globally for ALL references to the file(s)
   ```bash
   # Search for any references to files being changed
   git grep -n "old-filename"
   find . -type f -name "*.md" -o -name "*.yml" -o -name "*.json" | xargs grep -l "old-filename"
   ```

2. **Multi-Dimensional Update**: Update ALL discovered references simultaneously:
   - Documentation links and cross-references
   - Workflow trigger paths and file lists
   - Script file arguments and parameters
   - Configuration navigation and includes
   - Any hardcoded file paths or names

3. **Validation**: Test all affected systems after changes:
   ```bash
   # Test builds
   npm run build # or cargo build, etc.
   # Test documentation
   # Test automation workflows
   ```

**Success Pattern**:
- ‚úÖ Global search reveals ALL references before making changes
- ‚úÖ All references updated atomically in same commit
- ‚úÖ Validation tools run to confirm no broken links or references
- ‚úÖ CI workflows tested to ensure they pass after changes

### Documentation Link Format Standards

**Critical Rule**: Test your documentation link formats with the specific tools in your ecosystem.

**Universal Principle**: Different documentation tools have different link interpretation rules. What works for one tool may break validation in another.

**Example: GitHub + MkDocs Ecosystem**:

1. **Internal Documentation Links** (within docs/ folder):
   ```markdown
   # ‚úÖ CORRECT - Direct file references
   [Quick Start](quickstart.md)
   [Installation Guide](installation.md)

   # ‚ùå INCORRECT - Directory-style (may break validation)
   [Quick Start](quickstart/)
   [Installation Guide](installation/)
   ```

2. **Documentation Site URLs** (external references):
   ```markdown
   # ‚úÖ CORRECT - No trailing slashes
   https://your-site.github.io/project/quickstart
   https://your-site.github.io/project/installation

   # ‚ùå INCORRECT - Trailing slashes (may cause 404 errors)
   https://your-site.github.io/project/quickstart/
   https://your-site.github.io/project/installation/
   ```

**Your Validation Process**:
1. **Identify Your Tools**: What documentation generator do you use? What link validator?
2. **Test with Documentation Generator**: Ensure site generates correctly
3. **Test with Link Validators**: Ensure CI validation passes
4. **Manual Verification**: Click links in both rendered and raw formats

**Other Common Ecosystems**:
- **GitLab + Hugo**: Different link format requirements
- **Bitbucket + Jekyll**: Different validation rules
- **Notion + Custom**: Completely different link handling

**Adaptation Required**: These examples show GitHub + MkDocs patterns. You must test and adapt link formats for your specific tool combination.

### Preferred Development Tools

**Critical Rule**: Use the fastest, most reliable tools available for common operations.

**Modern Development Tools** (use when available, with fallbacks):

**Search and File Operations**:
- **git grep** - Search git-tracked files (repository scope, most accurate for version control)
- **ripgrep (`rg`)** - Search filesystem (broader scope, 10-100x faster than grep, respects .gitignore)
- **fd (`fd`)** - Find files (faster than find, simpler syntax, respects .gitignore)
- **/bin/ls** - Use full path to bypass slow aliases (developers often alias ls to colorized versions)

**Package Managers** (by ecosystem):
- **pnpm** over npm - Faster installs, disk space efficient, strict dependency resolution
- **bun** - Ultra-fast JavaScript runtime and package manager
- **uv** over pip - Extremely fast Python package manager (10-100x faster)

**Developer Experience**:
- **zoxide (`z`)** - Smart cd that learns your patterns
- **fzf** - Fuzzy finder for files, history, processes
- **delta** - Better git diff with syntax highlighting
- **dust (`dust`)** - Disk usage analyzer (better than du)
- **procs** - Modern ps with tree view and search
- **sd** - Intuitive sed alternative for find-and-replace
- **tokei** - Fast code statistics (lines of code, languages)

**Tool Selection by Use Case**:
```bash
# Search git-tracked files (most common for repository analysis)
git grep "pattern"                    # searches git index
git grep -n "pattern"                 # with line numbers

# Search all files (broader analysis, includes untracked)
rg "pattern"                          # fast filesystem search
rg "pattern" --type py                # specific file types
rg "pattern" -A 3 -B 3               # with context

# Find files (locate files by name/pattern)
fd "filename"                         # fast file finding
fd -e py                              # by extension
fd -t f "pattern"                     # files only

# List files (bypass slow aliases)
/bin/ls -la                           # use full path to bypass colorized aliases
command ls -la                        # alternative: use command builtin
\\ls -la                              # alternative: escape alias with backslash

# Package management (JavaScript)
pnpm install                          # faster, more efficient
bun install                           # ultra-fast alternative
npm install                           # fallback

# Package management (Python)
uv pip install package                # extremely fast pip replacement
pip install package                   # fallback

# Find-and-replace
sd "old" "new" file                   # intuitive sed alternative
sed 's/old/new/g' file               # fallback

# Tool availability checks
command -v pnpm >/dev/null && pnpm install || npm install
command -v uv >/dev/null && uv pip install package || pip install package

# Fast ls (bypass aliases)
/bin/ls -la                           # always use native ls for performance
```

**Why These Tools Matter**:
- **Performance**: 10-100x speed improvement for large codebases and operations
- **Ergonomics**: Better defaults, cleaner output, more intuitive syntax
- **Git Integration**: Automatically respects .gitignore, shows git status, integrates with workflows
- **Developer Experience**: Syntax highlighting, fuzzy finding, intelligent suggestions
- **Modern Standards**: Becoming standard in modern development environments
- **Disk Efficiency**: Tools like pnpm save significant disk space and bandwidth

**Installation Check**:
```bash
# Core modern tools check
echo "Checking modern development tools..."
command -v rg && echo "‚úÖ ripgrep" || echo "‚ùå ripgrep (install: brew install ripgrep)"
command -v fd && echo "‚úÖ fd" || echo "‚ùå fd (install: brew install fd)"
command -v pnpm && echo "‚úÖ pnpm" || echo "‚ùå pnpm (install: npm install -g pnpm)"
command -v uv && echo "‚úÖ uv" || echo "‚ùå uv (install: pip install uv)"
test -x /bin/ls && echo "‚úÖ native ls available" || echo "‚ùå /bin/ls not found"

# Alternative: one-liner check
(command -v rg && command -v fd) >/dev/null && echo "‚úÖ Core modern tools available" || echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Consider installing modern CLI tools for better performance"
```

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation
- **Performance Tests**: Timing and resource usage
- **User Acceptance Tests**: Real-world usage scenarios

### Release Process
1. **Version Management**: Use consistent versioning across all project files
2. **Testing**: Full test suite on multiple platforms/environments
3. **Documentation**: Update all relevant documentation
4. **Artifact Generation**: Create and verify release artifacts
5. **Announcement**: Clear release notes highlighting changes and upgrade paths
